# Card-App
A simple Congratulations Card App

This app has a layout made using XML. It was made as a part of Udacity's Google Android Challenge Scholorship Programme.
The main_activity.xml has a layout with two TextViews and one ImageView. The attributes in the views can be changed for different looks.

If you want to try out this app, then place the activity_main.xml file in /YourApp/app/src/main/res/layout/ folder and run it in Android Studio.
